            <p>Architects use weird terminologies. Usually, these terms usually don’t have a unified meaning <i>(e.g. uniformity, anti-object)</i>, and sometimes are borrowed from other disciplines, while meaning something completely different <i>(e.g. deconstructivism, phenomenology)</i>. Even simple words <i>(e.g. space, order)</i> are not agreed upon.<a href ="https://books.google.com/books/about/Words_and_Buildings.html?id=J7VvQgAACAAJ" target="_blank">[1]</a></p>

            <p>Architecture is one of the most complicated fields.<a href="http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/Complexity%20in%20Architecture%20and%20Design.pdf" target="_blank">[3]</a> An architect has to not only consider aesthetics and functions, but also recognize materials, construction, safety, and the impact on society. Therefore, terms are coined to provide abstraction for verbose and complex ideas, to help improve both the accuracy and the efficiency within architects’ discourses. It's interesting to note that when talking to clients, the best architects don't use terminologies.<a href="http://www.coffeewithanarchitect.com/2012/01/23/talking-to-clients/" target="_blank">[4]</a></p>
            <p>In architecture schools, however, despite instructors' preparation and limitations, students often still get lost with so many aspects of an architectural design. It's not uncommon for students to <em>slap on</em> some complex jargons to defend their designs at the reviews.<a href="https://archinect.com/forum/thread/86689254/how-to-subvert-the-culture-of-pretentious-bullshit-at-my-school" target="_blank">[5]</a> That's part of the motivation behind this thesis: can language become <em>a more helpful and generative design tool</em>, rather than just a mere afterthought?<br><br></p>

            <p>Another motivation for the thesis comes from my fascination with language. Language is powerful because it's highly visual/experiential. Everyone is generating different but detailed and engaging <em>mental images</em> when they're reading. Ronald Finke described 5 general principles for mental imagery.<a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1989-98796-000" target="_blank">[6]</a> The first two principles <i>("Abstraction" and "Schemas")</i> reveal more on the topic of subjectivity: even the "weird words" mentioned previously, could be highly visual to experts. Naturally, </p>
            <p>From another angle, studies done by Rain Chan-Kalin (SoA Thesis 2015)<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/millergalleryatcarnegiemellonuniversity/18201848872" target="_blank">[7]</a> proposed a method where language could be used, instead of renderings, to communicate to clients in early phases of the design process, as renderings are time-consuming and need to be modeled in detail.</p>
            <p>However, to judge the potential for language as a generative design tool, we need to investigate the <em>usages and limits</em> of language and mental images.</p>

        <div class="container">
          <div class="exp">
            <p>When I proposed that I wish to develop a design tool using language, the first critique I got was: How is the <em>general</em> design tool going to account for the <em>subjectivity</em> of language? If visualization from language is deeply tied in with memories <i>(e.g. "cozy")</i>, there would be no way of translating that to a general experience. </p>
            <p>Instead of getting bogged down in the plethora of possibilities, It's helpful to sort out the factors impacting the subjectivity. Using established cognitive science models<a href = "https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/81/KPM-Ginet-040218.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank">[8]</a>, one can start to get a sense on where subjectivity arise. The following factors are studied and examined in the later part of the study.</p>
            <p><em>User perception:</em> To what extent and detail do the user perceive the environment?</p>
            <p><em>User knowledge <i>("Abstraction""Schema")</i>:</em> Does the user know how to describe their perception? Does the user have memories that might affect the way they perceive certain things?</p>
            <p><em>Availability of the language:</em> Is there appropriate language for the perception?
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="exp3">
            <p>In Kevin Lynch's over-quoted <i>The Image of the City</i><a href = "https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/image-city" target="_blank">[9]</a>, Lynch asked people to draw <em>"mental maps"</em> of their neighborhood. He found that people understood and drew their surroundings with five basic, consistent, and predictable elements: paths, edges, districts, nodes, and landmarks. The actual maps can be totally different and malleable, but as long as it includes the elements, the map becomes immediately recognizable.</p>
            <p>I'm wondering if the same could be said about architectural spaces and language. What if people could make <em>"mental models"</em>? Can I find a nice ground for my language design tool to work?</p>

          <div class="interview">
            <p class="question">How would you visualize the space for your high school friend who's never been here?</p>
            <p class="speech-bubble">It is a double-height atrium space with skylights. There are tartan flags hanging from the ceiling. There are 2 circular staircases going up to the second floor.</p>
            <p class="question">When I say "UC Black Chairs", you should have a specific mental image in your head. Could you describe that for me?</p>
            <p class="speech-bubble">I'm just outside the info desk, looking up at the 2nd story, and the skylight is very fascinating. A lot of people come and go, but none of them is studying. There are white walls, yellow bricks, gray carpet and black chairs. There is dense traffic in both directions from the curved staircases.</p>
            <p class="question">Do you have more opinions about the design of the space?</p>
            <p class="speech-bubble">Though I mostly like the space, the color and furniture choices are questionable. The tartan on the ceiling doesn't match well with the cream bricks or the white walls. The shape of the space is unconventional but interesting. It is not homely, and It is not comfortable to study, despite the comfort of the black chairs. It is not intimate, because of the height and the large traffic. It is an extremely open space and It is used to its best abilities. Acoustic wise, there is very little echo, and you can hear everything that's going on.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="exp3">
            <p>At the step of the thesis, I'm eager to find out what kind of words and sentences people tend to use to describe spaces, what kinds of pattern can I extract, and what could it mean for the final design tool. I decided to interview people ask them to describe an interior space and analyze their responses.</p>
            <p>I have chosen the <a href="./../imgs/UC-Black-Chairs.jpg" target="_blank">UC Black Chair space</a> as a case study example, because it's unavoidable to most people on campus. Initially, I wished to interview different groups of people and find out more about the difference in their perceptions, but I switched to only interviewing architecture/design students half way, to aim to help building the final product.</p>
            <p>The interviewees are asked about 1. How would they <em>introduce</em> the space to someone who has never been there; 2. Describe the <em>specific mental image</em> about the space; 3. If there's any professional comments about the space.</p>
            <p>On the left is a sample interview. In the actual process, I often needed to guide the interviewee for a more meaningful response. A total of 45 architecture students were interviewed. These are added to the dataset and analyzed by myself and NLP libraries. I also added 20 Non-architecture major interviews with excellent responses.</p>
